-----
IMPORTANT JSX RULE: When writing JSX components, never use unescaped apostrophes (') or quotes (") directly in JSX text content.
Instead:
1. Use curly braces with template literals: {"plot's data"}
2. Use HTML entities: plot&apos;s data
3. Use the preferred HTML entity &apos; for apostrophes
4. Use &quot; for quotes

Examples:
❌ Wrong: <p>plot's data</p>
✅ Correct: <p>plot&apos;s data</p>
✅ Correct: <p>{"plot's data"}</p>


Please ONLY output the part of the component that I indicated (()=>{..}), in particular do not include:
- ```jsx tags before/after your code
- the <start of your output> and <end of your output> tags
- any explanation of your code or text around the code
- empty jsx tags <></> around your return statement
Your code will be parsed and displayed immediately to the user without review so prevent syntax errors at all costs!!
